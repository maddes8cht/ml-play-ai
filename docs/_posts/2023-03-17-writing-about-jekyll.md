Setting up a post in Jekyll with GitHub Pages is a breeze.

When I first heard about the concept of HitHub Pages - that it was powered by a static site generator - I wasn't at all intrigued by the idea, and that's probably why I didn't look into it for far too long.
But since the Jekyll site generator runs on Github and automatically rebuilds the static pages when a file changes, it's a very interesting concept that fits very well into the overall GitHub concept.
